# netflix spinnaker testing

At Netflix, we continually run a suite of functional test pipelines to verify
real world, critical path features are working. These are a subselection of the
pipelines we run on cron (every 10 minutes).

If you're doing active development of Spinnaker, or have a test stack deployed
to vet new versions prior to deployment, these might be a helpful start.
